## UN Convention of Persons with Disabilties
@snapend

@snap[midpoint span-90 text-white]
"..promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity."
@snapend

Note:
signed by Barack Obama in 2009, but not ratified in the US. Some people feel ratification requires nations to give up their sovereignty in too many areas pertaining to citizens with disabilities.

## Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
@snapend

@ul[text-08]
- Originally focused on physical locations @note[there was no Web in 1990]
- Broadly written to apply to future technologies
- Dominos lawsuit
@ulend

Note:
- The Ninth Circuit Opinion said people with disabilities could sue under the Americans with Disabilities Act about websites and mobile applications they cannot use. Dominos disagreed and wanted Supreme court to decide. 
- Supreme Court argreed that people can sue under ADA for website accessibility; So lawsuit against Dominos can continue. This was a win for accessibility
- Dominos wants clear guidelines within the ADA of what it means for websites to be accessible. Says without "rules" ADA can't be enforced on the web.
